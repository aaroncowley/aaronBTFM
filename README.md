# Aaron's Blue Team Field Manual
## Intro
I decided to create my printable CCDC binder as a slick markdown document that I can export to PDF via pandoc.  I also wanted to compile some of my common google searches into a resource I can access quicker and can git pull for easy copying and pasting of commands.  This is not to be an all inclusive document or even to really replace the original BTFM, it is simply the stuff I would like to have access to easily.
